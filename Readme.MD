The Rising SWGEmu Server

This is a port of The old Nightwing code from when Nightwing and Phoenix split. For information about the contributors to the original codebase please see Toxic's repository:

Since then, the code has been modified heavily for stability, balance and content. Here are some of the folks that have helped make this happen:

Blasto - Balance and content ideas. Lots of testing on testcenter

Mindbust - Client-side Tre File work, balance ideas, bug hunting through codebase, external research, and lots of time on the test center

DocHoliday - Weaponcrafting balance ideas and research

Kumo - Balance and content ideas. Took the lead on Boss revamp and loot distribution patch. Created loot tables, found new locations for bosses, research loot groups to find unique items to include. Tons of time spent on test center testing boss combat, loot drops, etc.
